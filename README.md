# Logs Analysis Project

This is the first project for Udacity's [Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd004) program. 

A [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) database of an imaginary news website is provided with the following 3 tables: 
- Articles
- Authors
- Log

Students are assigned to write three seperate advanced SQL queries and execute them in Python using [Psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/) as a PostgreSQL adapter.

## To run project

1. Clone this repo.  
1. Download and install PostgreSQL: https://www.postgresql.org/download/
3. Download and install Psycopg: http://initd.org/psycopg/download/
4. Run newsdb.py by typing `python newsdb.py` or `python3 newsdb.py` if using Python3 in your command line.  

## Views

2 views are created in the execution of the 3rd query using the `create view` statement:
-errorcalc
-percentages
